        <p class="parashome1">1. Yala National Park</p>
        <p class="parashome">Yala National Park, located in the southeastern part of Sri Lanka, is renowned for its high density of leopards, making it one of the best places in the world for leopard sightings. The park's varied habitats, including dense forests, grasslands, and coastal dunes, provide ideal conditions for leopards to thrive. Visitors to Yala have a good chance of spotting these elusive big cats, particularly during early morning and late afternoon safaris.</p>
        <p class="parashome1">2. Wilpattu National Park</p>
        <p class="parashome">Wilpattu National Park, situated in the northwest of Sri Lanka, is another prime location for leopard sightings. Known for its dense forest cover, natural lakes, and open grasslands, Wilpattu offers ample opportunities for leopard encounters amidst its pristine wilderness. The park's undulating terrain and numerous watering holes provide ideal conditions for leopards to roam freely and hunt, offering visitors a chance to observe these majestic predators in their natural habitat.</p>
        <p class="parashome1">3. Horton Plains National Park</p>
        <p class="parashome">Although not as renowned for leopard sightings as Yala and Wilpattu, Horton Plains National Park, located in the central highlands of Sri Lanka, is home to a population of leopards. The park's montane grasslands, cloud forests, and rugged terrain provide suitable habitat for leopards, albeit sightings are less frequent compared to other parks. However, Horton Plains offers a unique opportunity to spot leopards in a cooler, high-altitude environment, amidst stunning landscapes including Baker's Falls and World's End.</p>

            <img class="threats" src="habitat loss.jpg" alt="Habitat Loss">           
            <p class="habitatdef">Habitat loss refers to the destruction, degradation, or fragmentation of natural habitats, often caused by human activities such as deforestation, urbanization, agriculture, and infrastructure development. This threat poses significant consequences for biodiversity, including loss of habitat for wildlife, disruption of ecological processes, and reduction in species populations. Habitat loss can lead to habitat fragmentation, isolating populations and limiting their ability to disperse, mate, and find resources, ultimately increasing their vulnerability to extinction.</p>
            <p class="parashome1">Mechanisms taken to reduce the threat include:</p>
            <p class="p">
                1.Protected Areas Establishment: Creating and effectively managing protected areas such as national parks, wildlife reserves, and sanctuaries to safeguard critical habitats from further degradation and destruction. <br>
                2.Habitat Restoration: Implementing habitat restoration projects to rehabilitate degraded ecosystems and re-establish native vegetation, providing vital habitat for wildlife and promoting ecosystem resilience. <br>
                3.Land Use Planning: Implementing land use planning and zoning regulations to minimize habitat loss and fragmentation, ensuring sustainable land management practices that balance conservation and development needs. <br>
                4.Community Engagement: Involving local communities in habitat conservation efforts through education, awareness programs, and sustainable livelihood initiatives, fostering stewardship and promoting coexistence between humans and wildlife. <br>
                5.Legislation and Enforcement: Enforcing wildlife protection laws, regulations, and policies to prevent illegal land clearing, logging, and encroachment into protected areas, ensuring accountability and deterrence against habitat destruction activities. <br>
                6.Public Awareness and Advocacy: Raising public awareness about the importance of habitat conservation and biodiversity protection through advocacy campaigns, outreach programs, and environmental education initiatives, mobilizing support for conservation efforts at local, national, and global levels. <br>

        <div class="threat">
            
            <img class="threats" src="Poaching.jpg" alt="Poaching">
            <p class="habitatdef">Poaching refers to the illegal hunting, killing, or capturing of wild animals, often for their valuable parts such as ivory, horns, or skins. This illicit practice poses a severe threat to wildlife populations and biodiversity, leading to population declines, species extinctions, and disruptions to ecosystems. Poaching not only decimates targeted species but also destabilizes ecosystems, disrupts food chains, and undermines conservation efforts, ultimately jeopardizing the balance of natural habitats.</p>
            <p class="parashome1">Consequences</p>
            <p class="p">
                1. Decline in Wildlife Populations: Poaching leads to a significant decline in populations of targeted species, pushing them towards extinction and disrupting ecological balance. <br>
                2. Loss of Biodiversity: Poaching contributes to the loss of biodiversity by driving certain species to extinction and reducing overall species diversity within ecosystems. <br>
                3. Economic Impact: Poaching negatively impacts local economies dependent on wildlife-based tourism, resulting in loss of revenue and livelihoods for communities. <br>
                4. Ecosystem Imbalance: The removal of key species through poaching can disrupt ecosystem dynamics, leading to cascading effects on other species and ecological processes. <br>
                5. Legal and Social Implications: Poaching undermines wildlife conservation laws and regulations, erodes social norms, and perpetuates illegal trade networks, posing challenges to law enforcement and community well-being. <br>
            </p>
            <p class="parashome1">Mechanisms taken to reduce the threat include: </p>
            <p class="p">
                1. Anti-Poaching Patrols: Implementing rigorous anti-poaching patrols and enforcement operations in wildlife reserves and protected areas to deter poachers and apprehend illegal hunters. <br>
                2. Community Engagement: Engaging local communities in conservation efforts through education, awareness programs, and sustainable livelihood initiatives to foster a sense of stewardship and discourage participation in poaching activities. <br>
                3. Legislation and Law Enforcement: Strengthening wildlife protection laws, regulations, and penalties, and enhancing law enforcement measures to combat poaching and disrupt illegal wildlife trade networks. <br>
                4. Technology and Surveillance: Utilizing advanced technologies such as drones, camera traps, and satellite monitoring to enhance surveillance and detection of poaching activities in remote areas. <br>
                5. International Cooperation: Collaborating with international organizations, governments, and NGOs to address transnational poaching networks, strengthen border controls, and promote global initiatives to combat wildlife crime. <br>
